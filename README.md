# VizSort
**Goal:** Use SwiftUI to visualize sorting algorithms.

Watch as the Bubble Sort algorithm slowly sorts elements from
smallest to largest.

## Operation
Upon launching the application, press the **Reset** button to generate an
array of random integers. Press the **Sort** button to sort the array using
Bubble Sort.

## Why BubbleSort?
It's fun to watch.

## Gotchas
There is no way to cancel a running sort.

## Possible Improvements
* Better job control. Provide a cancel button.
* Allow user to select from multiple sorting algorithms.
* Dynamic array size. Allow the user to specify the sorting algorithm to use.
* Stats display. Provide performance metrics in a heads-up display.

## Bugs
Probably.
